# Original description with updates:

NativeDriver is an implementation of the [*WebDriver API*](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/api.html) which drives of the UI of a native application rather than a web application.

We plan to make NativeDriver a multi-platform tool. We are currently working on the following versions:

- Android - Usable and avaliable in this repository.
- iOS - Usable and avaliable in this repository.
- Windows - Experimental and prototype phase. Not tested in this repository; Neither checked for it's avaliability.

WebDriver is used to do functional testing of web applications on many platforms and browsers.
By applying WebDriver and all related technologies to native applications, we hope to bridge the gap and alleviate the impedance mismatch between Web Applications and Native Applications.
